# ML
Learning ML from scratch.
This learning journey started from completing the basics course of Probabily and Statistics of Krrish Naik,
And eventually learning Basics of Python from Code with Harry.
And now comes the part when learning ML from Stanford Online(Course No. CS229), by Proff. Andrew NG is there!
